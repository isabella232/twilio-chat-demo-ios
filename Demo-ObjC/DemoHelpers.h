 If the email is absent or unmatched by Gravatar, we will fall back to the behavior of avatarForAuthor:size:scalingFactor: which is to use the identity string to generate a random avatar.
 
 @param user The TCHUser to use when obtaining or generating the avatar.
 @param size The desired size (used for both width and height) of the returned image.
 @param scale The UI scaling factor to use (typically 2.0 for many retina displays).

/** Helper method to generate a deep mutable copy of the specified dictionary.
 
 When mutating userInfo on channels or users in Programmable Chat, it is often handy to get a mutable copy of the dictionary.  By default, NSDictionary's `mutableCopy` method only makes mutable the specified dictionary, not any values whose type are NSArray or NSDictionary.  This method uses a core foundation method to create a truly deep copy.
 
 @param dictionary The input (presumed immutable) dictionary.
 @return A deep mutable copy of the supplied dictionary.
 */
+ (nonnull NSMutableDictionary *)deepMutableCopyOfDictionary:(nullable NSDictionary *)dictionary;

/** Adds the specified identity as having reacted to a message with the given emojiString.
 
 Messages within Programmable Chat may have developer defined userInfo attributes.  We make use of such attributes in the demo application to support users reacting to a message.
 
 When a user reacts to a message with a given emojiString, we make a new entry in a dictionary on the message's userInfo of the format:
 `"reactions": [
    {
        "reaction": <emojiString>,
        "users": [
            @"alice",
            @"bob"
        ]
    }
 ]`
 
 As users react (or remove their reaction) the items in 'users' are updated to include or remove their identity.  The first user to react with a given emojiString creates a new entry in the reactions array.  The last user to remove their reaction likewise deletes that array.
 
 @param emojiString The text name of the emoji to display.
 @param message The message to modify the reaction on.
 @param identity The identity of the user reacting to the message.
 @see reactionDecrement:message:user:

 @param emojiString The text name of the emoji to display.
 @param message The message to modify the reaction on.
 @param identity The identity of the user reacting to the message.

/** Helper to simplify the display of unconsumed messages for the current user on a channel.
 
 Today, `getUnconsumedMessagesCountWithCompletion:` will return 0 in the event the user does not have a consumption status on the channel.  This can occur if the user is a brand new member of a channel or after calling TCHMessages' `setNoMessagesConsumed`.
 
 This method temporarily works around that by checking if the user has a consumption status on the channel and, if not, returns the total message count on the channel instead.
 
 Note that this will still return a count of 0 if called before the channel is fully synchronized so care should be taken to use the value only if the channel is synchronized.
 
 @param channel The channel to request the count for.
 @param completion The completion block which will receive the response.

/** Download the media for the given TCHMessage.
 
 This method wraps the standard media fetching method on TCHMessage with the following functionality:
 - Will fulfill the image request from cache, if the media is present locally.
 - Prevents multiple simultaneous downloads from occuring, allowing one download to occur at a time and keeping other requests queued to either be fulfilled by the result of the current download or attempt the download again if it fails.  If the media operation takes more than 5 minutes, the operation will be assumed to be failed and allow the next request in line to complete.
 
 The queueing behavior only applies to repeat requests for the same piece of media - multiple requests on multiple TCHMessage objects will be executed simultaneously.
 
 @param message The TCHMessage for which to load the media.
 @param progressUpdate Update block which will be called with the number of bytes downloaded so far.
 @param completion Completion block which will be called with the image if the operation is successful or nil if unsuccessful.
